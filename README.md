I used play framework for this task.

I have 3-5 hours for complete this task.
My most project in spring boot.
I don't familier with play framework. 
I spent some of my time to learn structure and install sbt tools.
So I didn't create database etc. 
I just keep all values in list. I added this list.

I created index page. I write usage information in there.

To run application you need java 8. 
You can download application in root folder. Application name is huseyin-revoult-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
In this zip file bat or shell script should run. This scripts are under bin folder. 

So as I mention I always use spring boot for my project.

There is one project microservice development with spring boot cloud eureka and mongodb.

Also some batch process with spring batch framework;
